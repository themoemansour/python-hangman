# Python Hangman Game 🕵️‍♂️🎮

## Overview
Welcome to **Hangman** – the classic word-guessing game with a fun twist! Test your knowledge of **countries and cities** while trying to guess the secret word before running out of attempts. This game is a great way to challenge yourself and improve your vocabulary in a fun and engaging way.

## Features 🌟
- **Two Exciting Categories**: Choose between **Countries** or **Major Cities**.
- **15+ Words Per Category**: A diverse set of words ensures a fresh experience each time.
- **First Letter Reveal**: To make things easier, the first letter of the word is always shown at the start.
- **No Double Penalties**: If you guess a letter incorrectly but have already tried it before, you won’t be penalized twice.
- **Simple & Interactive Gameplay**: Enjoy a smooth and intuitive text-based interface.

## How to Play 🎲
1. **Choose a Category**: Pick either **Countries** or **Cities**.
2. **Start Guessing**: The first letter is already revealed, so guess letters one at a time.
3. **Track Your Guesses**: Incorrect guesses reduce your allowed attempts (you get 5 chances!).
4. **Win or Lose**:
   - If you guess all letters correctly, you win! 🎉
   - If you run out of attempts, the game ends, revealing the correct word.
